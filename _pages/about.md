Hi! I'm an undergraduate fourth-year student in [BEng Computer Science](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/ug/comp/), with minors in [Business](https://bmundergrad.hkust.edu.hk/academics/academic-programs/minor-programs) and [Math](https://www.math.hkust.edu.hk/ug/minor.php), at [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/).

During my undergraduate study, I have worked with [Prof. Yu-Wing Tai](https://yuwingtai.github.io/) and [Prof. Chi-Keung Tang](https://home.cse.ust.hk/~cktang/bio.html) for text/video-guided audio generation. Prior to that, I did a research study with [Prof. Shuiguang Deng](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/shuiguang) on imbalanced semi-supervised learning, at Zhejiang University.
