Final Note:
1. Some professor doesn't offer UROP project. Instead, you can register a course called COMP 4971 Independent Work. Normally professor at CSE will give you decent grade if you work hard.

2. If you plan to persue a graduate study in Hong Kong, the grade at UG Year 4 may still matter during application (especially if you want any scholarship). My bloody experience QwQ
